### What are your Fund Choices?
- **Stocks** - a share of ownership of a publicly traded company.

- **Mutual Funds** - investment strategy that allows you to pool your money together with other investors to purchase a collection of stocks, bonds, or other securities that might be difficult to recreate on your own. This is often actively managed by a fund advisor.

- **Index Funds** - investment fund that aims to replicate the movements of an index or specific financial market. These can be actively managed or managed by computers, the latter of which are often options with lower costs to the investor.

- **Robo-Advisors** - online wealth management service that provides automated, algorithm-based portfolio management advice without the use human financial planners and often with minimal human intervention.
