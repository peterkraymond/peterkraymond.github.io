## Peter K Raymond Website

This is a personal website serving a variety of purposes: Personal Branding, CV, Blog, etc... 
Work for this site was based around the amazing resources and work that people have put out for others to build upon. I attempt to site the original creators of this material below. I have modified their creations to serve my needs.
