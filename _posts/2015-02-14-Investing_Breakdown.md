I am just diving into understanding more investment decisions. There is much to be learned and much more technical analysis to be done. Below is a transparent glance into my own perspective and process when setting up my portfolio. There are too many resources to look at and I rely on some great minds for help along the way. Thank you to all who have shared valuable feedback throughout this process. In addition to my conversations and online resources below, my understanding has come from a couple of books:

- [http://www.amazon.com/Will-Teach-You-To-Rich/dp/0761147489](http://www.amazon.com/Will-Teach-You-To-Rich/dp/0761147489)

Next Steps
==========

After some analysis, with a variety of different allocations being backtested, I think I will opt for something similar to the SIGFIG allocation. [See Analysis Here](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-asset-class-allocation?s=y&IntlStockMarket2=20&portfolio3=Custom&portfolio2=Custom&portfolio1=David+Swensen+Yale+Endowment&TIPS1=15&Commodities3=7.5&annualOperation=1&TotalStockMarket3=30&TotalStockMarket2=34&TotalStockMarket1=30&initialAmount=10000&EmergingMarket2=20&EmergingMarket1=5&endYear=2014&mode=2&annualAdjustment=10000&startYear=1972&Gold3=7.5&InterTaxExempt3=15&rebalanceType=1&annualPercentage=0.0&EAFE1=15&LongTermBond2=12&LongTermBond1=15&LongTermBond3=40&REIT2=14&REIT1=20).

- VIOV was lowest performer out of group. All others were a tossup. VIOG seemed to be one of the best performers in the shorter term. All within 2% longer timeline. 


#### Mid Cap Comparison

- VO - seems like the winner of the group.


#### Large Cap Comparison

- No clear winner. PJP is a definite for being in the lead. SPHQ has been performing well in the shorter term. SCHG also a reasonable option. 


#### Developing and Emerging Markets

[Yahoo Finance - Developed and Emerging Comparison](http://finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=VEA+Interactive#%7B%22range%22%3A%223mo%22%2C%22scale%22%3A%22linear%22%2C%22comparisons%22%3A%7B%22ADRA%22%3A%7B%22color%22%3A%22%23cc0000%22%2C%22weight%22%3A1%7D%2C%22VWO%22%3A%7B%22color%22%3A%22%23009999%22%2C%22weight%22%3A1%7D%7D%7D)
- Keeping VWO for Developing Markets and need to choose between VEA and ADRA. ADRA seems to fair better but has higher expense ratio. It would be nice to look at percentage return needed to make the additional expense worthwhile (if it is not negligible).


#### Others

- VGLT and KBWY best choices



<br>



Future Allocation
-----------------

- 34% - US Stock Market
    + VIOG - Small Cap
    + VO - Mid Cap
    + PJP - Large Blend
    + SPHQ or SCHG - Large Cap
    + VINIX and VMCIX - Market and Mid Cap in 401k
- 14% - REIT
    + KBWY
- 20% - International Stock Market
    + VEA or ADRA
- 20% - Emerging Markets
    + VWO
- 12% - Long Term Bonds
    + VGLT


I could adjust percentages in the short term, but for the longterm with backtesting, this allocation performed well over the last 30 years. I understand this doesn't mean that it will perform the same into the future.


#### Decisions

- Should I adjust allocation in 401k to also be more balanced?
- How much of my savings account should be invested? Current thought is to save $6-10k for Emergency Fund. I figure I could invest my money in my savings account through my Robinhood account which doesn't have fees with a buy and hold strategy. In this account, I would consider investing in other individual stocks if there were some that I believed had a particular strong outlook for the future.
- As long as it is a "bull run" should I stay heavy in large cap? If so, I am considering something like the following for the next year:


##### Early Allocation

- 54% - US Stock Market
    + VIOG - 13% - Small Cap
    + VO - 13% - Mid Cap
    + PJP - 13% **current** - Large Blend
    + SPHQ or SCHG - 15% - Large Cap
    + VINIX and VMCIX - Market and Mid Cap **in 401k**
- 14% - REIT
    + KBWY
- 10% - International Stock Market
    + VEA or ADRA
- 10% - Emerging Markets
    + VWO
- 12% - Long Term Bonds
    + VGLT
