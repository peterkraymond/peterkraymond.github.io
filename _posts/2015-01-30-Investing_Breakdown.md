Reflections
-----------

- VWO - Fairing poorly - looks like most emerging markets are comparable
- VEA - Developed Markets -  1yr view - not doing great
- AMJ - low performer for year, 2year, etc... 


- 5 year performance in order of Percentage Return - 
    + PJP

- Double up on FPX for large cap? 
	- It has faired well (in top 2 and top 5 for all views 3month - 5year)
	- But, it doesn't have great ratings on MarketEdge of Scottrade

- Can I go more heavily into any sector of the market that I see positive moving forward? PJP has been a strong performer for pharmaceuticals. I see Biotech continuing positively in the future, are there funds I can look at for that? Anything in energy?

- Thoughts from Dad:

<img src="img/DadsList-2.jpg">

- Include more on breakdown of expense ratio costs:






- Also, Elon Musk has a few other energy companies that have the potential to make a large impact in the future. Email discussion thoughts from others:

    > I'm an Elon Musk fanboy (like many of us) so Tesla (TSLA) and Solar City (SCTY) are in the mix. I hold a very small amount of Tesla stock - which so far has lost value - but I'm optimistic it will turnaround once gas prices return to "normal". SolarCity (Musk's cousin's company) acquired the ability to produce their own panels on top of their original business model of leasing consumer rooftops. They struck a deal with Wal-Mart for installations on some of their stores. Vivint (VSLR) is a competitor without the manufacturing capacity, currently trading much lower (around 12 dollars/share at present) but with more potential upside down the road.

    > Continuing the Musk theme a bit, I would love to get in on a SpaceX IPO but since that company is not publicly traded yet, I'm interested in Orbital Sciences (ORB). This is the company behind the failed Antares rocket launch from this fall. They have a number of contracts in place for ISS missions and are probably undervalued because of the explosion. I'm much less interested (read: "zero") in companies in aerospace like Lockheed that overlap with Orbital, but make war machines. (Need to perform some due diligence to ensure that ORB does not either.)

    > Vestas (VWDRY / VWSYF) wind energy - the Danish world leader in wind turbine production - seems like a good stock to hold long term, but apparently market share has eroded due to Chinese companies developing their own technology.

    > Other renewable energy stocks that interest me are SunPower (SPWR) a panel manufacturer, and Brookfield Renewable Energy Partners (BEP).

    > Google seems like a safe but expensive long term position. Same with Apple.

    > Facebook/Twitter seem like bad bets. (I don't like the idea of investing in immaterial software/web apps that revolve around advertising to fickle tweens).

    > Honestly, the only tech company I would invest in would be Paperspace. I'm expecting an Instagram/Bitcoin-esque return on that investment. No pressure Dillon. ;)

    > Theme: I would invest in renewable energy/infrastructure/hardware stocks if I had the spare cash. I want to invest in companies building the future I think most of us thought we would already have by now.

    > ok everyone, I really wanted to love Robinhood. The design is nice, the promise of no friction 0 dollar trades was awesome and I felt in on something big with the invites. So, I funded my account with not an insignificant (for me) amount of money and was ready to trade some patterns that I felt would be costly to do in my normal accounts. Well, well once I did, I found out that:

    > 1. They only support straight market or limit buys, no trailing stops! What this means is that I can only set a fixed price to buy or sell a security, the strategy I wanted to trade involved repeated trailing stops, so that was out. I'm guessing they anticipated this and intentionally left this hygiene feature out.
    > 2. Their quotes are not real-time! This means different things to different people, but basically they show quotes older than the "realtime" stock ticker that comes free with the iphone. - I wouldn't be surprised if this is how they really make money!
    > 3. There is no research in the app, obviously it is a mobile trading platform, but there are basic signals that most stock dashboards display that are missing here. Infact you can't even watch very many stocks.

    > So ... What's it good for? Well for me the only other strategy in which 0 dollar trades matter is basket buying. Right now I have a list of 14 oil stocks that I'd like to buy once I get the right signal and hold long, that would cost me about 130 bucks to do in Fidelity so I will likely use Robinhood for that since its already setup and funded. Otherwise, on individual market trades, saving 5-7 dollars isn't really worth the hassle.

    > Otherwise, to me, it seems like the app promotes irresponsible trading practices to young people. Not really a very good thing.

    > My verdict, find a cheap full featured discount brokerage and use that. I've heard that Merriledge has 30 free trades a month with a minimum balance, probably others competing closely there too.

    > Anyway, a bit disappointed honestly. Anyone else have a different take? btw: my oil picks are: 

    > CVX
    > XOM
    > COP
    > SLB
    > CLR
    > VET
    > CEO
    > IPXHF
    > OISHF
    > BRGXF
    > TOT
    > BP
    > WNR
    > WPX
    > GST

    > These all track extremely close to the price of oil, are large established securities and are on all time lows. I'm basically waiting for q4 earnings to depress the prices further before I buy. I think within a year oil will be up to 70-90 dollars its below 50 dollars now.

    > Anyone else have picks/strategies?

Next Steps
==========

After some analysis, with a variety of different allocations being backtested, I think I will opt for something similar to the SIGFIG allocation. [See Analysis Here](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-asset-class-allocation?s=y&IntlStockMarket2=20&portfolio3=Custom&portfolio2=Custom&portfolio1=David+Swensen+Yale+Endowment&TIPS1=15&Commodities3=7.5&annualOperation=1&TotalStockMarket3=30&TotalStockMarket2=34&TotalStockMarket1=30&initialAmount=10000&EmergingMarket2=20&EmergingMarket1=5&endYear=2014&mode=2&annualAdjustment=10000&startYear=1972&Gold3=7.5&InterTaxExempt3=15&rebalanceType=1&annualPercentage=0.0&EAFE1=15&LongTermBond2=12&LongTermBond1=15&LongTermBond3=40&REIT2=14&REIT1=20).

- VIOV was lowest performer out of group. All others were a tossup. VIOG seemed to be one of the best performers in the shorter term. All within 2% longer timeline. 


#### Mid Cap Comparison

- VO - seems like the winner of the group.

- No clear winner. PJP is a definite for being in the lead. SPHQ has been performing well in the shorter term. SCHG also a reasonable option. 


#### Developing and Emerging Markets

[Yahoo Finance - Developed and Emerging Comparison](http://finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=VEA+Interactive#%7B%22range%22%3A%223mo%22%2C%22scale%22%3A%22linear%22%2C%22comparisons%22%3A%7B%22ADRA%22%3A%7B%22color%22%3A%22%23cc0000%22%2C%22weight%22%3A1%7D%2C%22VWO%22%3A%7B%22color%22%3A%22%23009999%22%2C%22weight%22%3A1%7D%7D%7D)
- Keeping VWO for Developing Markets and need to choose between VEA and ADRA. ADRA seems to fair better but has higher expense ratio. It would be nice to look at percentage return needed to make the additional expense worthwhile (if it is not negligible).


#### Others

Future Allocation
-----------------

- 34% - US Stock Market
    + VIOG - Small Cap
    + VO - Mid Cap
    + PJP - Large Blend
    + SPHQ or SCHG - Large Cap
    + VINIX and VMCIX - Market and Mid Cap in 401k
- 14% - REIT
    + KBWY
- 20% - International Stock Market
    + VEA or ADRA
- 20% - Emerging Markets
    + VWO
- 12% - Long Term Bonds
    + VGLT


I could adjust percentages in the short term, but for the longterm with backtesting, this allocation performed well over the last 30 years. I understand this doesn't mean that it will perform the same into the future.



#### Decisions

- Should I adjust allocation in 401k to also be more balanced?
- How much of my savings account should be invested? Current thought is to keep around $6-10k for Emergency Fund. I figure I could invest my money in my savings account through my Robinhood account which doesn't have fees with a buy and hold strategy. In this account, I would consider investing in other individual stocks if there were some that I believed had a particular strong outlook for the future.
- Thinking I may desire to invest $5500 for 2015 (or 2016) into Scottrade now for the entire year to get it in while I am doing this rebalancing.
- If it seems smart to stay heavy in Large Cap for the time being - should I consider something like the following for the next year:


##### Early Allocation - (estimate $23k)

- 54% - US Stock Market
    + VIOG - 13% - Small Cap
    + VO - 13% - Mid Cap
    + PJP - 13% **current** - Large Blend
    + SPHQ or SCHG - 15% - Large Cap
    + VINIX and VMCIX - Market and Mid Cap **in 401k**
- 14% - REIT
    + KBWY
- 10% - International Stock Market
    + VEA or ADRA
- 10% - Emerging Markets
    + VWO
- 12% - Long Term Bonds
    + VGLT
