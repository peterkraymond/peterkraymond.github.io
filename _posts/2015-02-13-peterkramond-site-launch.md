The site is live. Below I will try and outline some of the research I did to build this site and some of the valuable resources that I couldn't manage without. 

### Objective

I set out to create a personal portfolio that would allow me to share ideas, projects, and anything of the sort. I considered using other blog platforms but wanted more freedom for the content and styling than most gave me in a free and customizable package. 


### Implementation

I setup my site on github, powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). I use markdown to write my content, which is great because I have been on a bit of a markdown kick for nearly every file I am writing up and sharing with people right now. I found some great resources to understand more about how to get a website up and running on github and their explanations should be more valuable than a second hand summary of what they said.

My website was designed by hand with bootstrap and some existing themes I had found online. I have adapted each bit of content to fit my purpose, but many others are to thank for the resources and tutorials they put online for me to learn from.
