### What are your Fund Choices?
- **Stocks** - a share of ownership of a publicly traded company.

- **Mutual Funds** - investment strategy that allows you to pool your money together with other investors to purchase a collection of stocks, bonds, or other securities that might be difficult to recreate on your own. This is often actively managed by a fund advisor.

- **Index Funds** - investment fund that aims to replicate the movements of an index or specific financial market. These can be actively managed or managed by computers, the latter of which are often options with lower costs to the investor.

- **Robo-Advisors** - online wealth management service that provides automated, algorithm-based portfolio management advice without the use human financial planners and often with minimal human intervention.

### Investment Portfolios
Must take into account your tolerance for **risk** and preferences for **how involved** you desire to be when managing these investments. Likely, this portfolio will have some aspect of diversification, simply meaning it will be spread over a range of equity types, sectors, and geographical regions.


##### Most Hands Off

## Addendum

- http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2011/11/06/book-review-will-this-guy-really-teach-you-to-be-rich/
    - A really good money blog for the frugally minded. A particular quote I liked below:

"But I also understand there is some value to providing a good role model. Instead of telling people a few small tips, why not provide a complete role model that completely shocks people out of complacency, like the idea that you can become FREE 30-50 years earlier if you set yourself free right now from the idea that spending is a source of happiness?

"Spend on the things you love” sounds like a nice soul-satisfying message, unless you pause for a while and think, “Wait a minute – what if I don’t love THINGS? What if I’d rather Spend time on the things I love, rather than spending large sums of money on them? What if my spending level and happiness are actually completely unrelated?”"
